              I am an 4th year undergrad at Brown University concentrating in
              computer science, with particular interests in software
              engineering and game development. In addition to my coursework, I
              pursue personal projects that expand upon in-class experiences.
              Over summer 2021, I applied my software engineering skills during
              my internship at Onset Computing. Outside academics,  I am also
              part of the Brown's Varsity Men Crew Team, competing at high level
              collegiate championships.

              Onset's goal is to provide a means of measuring, storing, and
              managing environmental data through the use of loggers and
              monitors. These devices are used to collect information about the
              surrounding environment including but not limited to: water
              temperature and salinity, wind speeds, soil composition and
              humidity. They are often used in renewable energy systems or in
              agriculture and oceanic research. The loggers drastically simplify
              the data collection process by sending data directly to a data
              warehouse that Onset manages. Onset manufactures the montiors,
              loggers, and other devices needed, as well as writes the
              supporting software code.
              <br><br>
              I held a Software Engineering internship at Onset during the
              summer of 2021, working to enhance their software testing
              capabilities. Onset hosts several data warehouses; the largest one
              reserved for customers. In order to test their software and data
              load maximums, one of these such warehouses was dedicated to
              testing. Testing is an extremely important part of software
              engineering, especially when serving a large number of customers.
              I was part of a small team which was tasked with implementing a
              number of different programs which would test the load that the
              redshift servers were able to operate under. More specifically, I
              used SQL queries to dynamically gather data from the customer
              database on the number and type of each device that was active. I
              was then tasked to emulate each of these devices, and provide user
              commands so that the number and type of devices could be changed
              for different testing needs.
              <br><br>
              This software was implemented in Java, one of the languages I am
              most familiar with. As the only summer intern, and under the
              restrictions of Covid-19, I spent time familiarizing myself with
              agile software development and setting up a work laptop which
              could access and pull data from Onset's data warehouses.

              A private school in Barrington, Rhode Island, St. Andrew's School
              hosts summer programs for kids aged 8-15. In addition to athletic
              and artistic activities, these programs also include engineering,
              robotics, and 3D design components, which I had been a mentor for;
              after a few years, I was overseeing the entire program.   
              <br><br>
              One of the computer science and circuitry curriculums I helped to
              implement involved using Arduinos and breadboards. Though the
              introduction to coding was very difficult for most students of
              such a young age, we had groups that created a version of hangman
              using the LCD screen, or a Mario Kart timer using LED's. We would
              also spend time with more mechanical and simpler projects, such as
              egg drops and cars, aluminum foil boats, spaghetti towers, and
              paper airplane competitions!
              <br><br>
              For the robotics section of the camp, we would work with LEGO
              Mindstorms or Tetrix robots. The campers would start building from
              instructions, to learn how the different parts and pieces
              interact. From there, we would design different events for them to
              build robots to compete in. These events included sumo-bots, an
              obstacle course, drag racing, and tug-of-war. Oftentimes the
              groups would take inspiration from the BattleBots television
              series, adding claws or plows to their robots!
              <br><br>
              The design camp was often my favorite week of camp to lead. I
              would show the group the basics of 3D printing and how printers
              operate, giving them a live demo with my home-built 3D printer! We
              would research the extent to which 3D printers could be used (they
              are used to print parts for Spacecraft!) before sending them off
              to use a simple CAD software to design their own creations!
              Whether it was armies of tiny action figures, dream sports cars,
              or huge mansions, we would use the 3D printers in the classroom to
              print as many of their creations as possible before the end of the
              camp.

              I made a huge commitment during my first week at Brown: to walk on
              to the Men's Crew Team. I hadn't been fast enough in high school
              to be recruited, and as a Divison I, nationally ranked team,
              walking on meant that I could expect to spend more than 20 hours a
              week practicing alongside some of the fastest recruits in the
              world. 
              <br><br>
              Needless to say, rising to meet the standard of the team was much
              easier said than done. I struggled to stay motivated through the
              physical and mental stress caused by practices and racing.
              Internally I debated whether or not I would stay on the team the
              following year. This debate was settled at the culmination of my
              Freshman year, when the team competed at the IRA National
              Chamiponshp in May, placing 5th in the country. 
              <br><br>
              Though the team was not able to compete during the 2019-2020
              season due to Covid-19, we entered the spring of 2021 at full
              speed. 
              <br><br>
              After the selection process, I completed the season by racing as
              part of the second varsity crew at the IRAs, claiming 7th as a
              boat and 5th overall.
              <br><br>
              At the Head of the Charles Regatta in fall 2021, I took home a
              Gold medal in the Club Eights event.

              I've always been attracted to indie games. The idea of building a
              video game from the ground up captivates me, since the creative
              process involves drawing and digital design  
              <br><br>
              Implementing the engine and game code in a new way with new
              mechanics...
              <br><br>
              Building a fictional world and a mysterious story, complete with
              dialogue...
              <br><br>
              Drawing this world and its characters and bringing them to life
              with graphic design... 
              <br><br>
              Writing music and audio themes for each biome and character... 
              <br><br>
              Two of my favorite games -- Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight --
              inspired me to begin this process myself by first implementing my
              own 2D game engine. It is written in Java, and followed the
              standard modern architecture for game engines using game object
              and component based systems. It supports collisions, configurable
              physics, animation, AI scripting, and much more!
              <br><br>
              I took this knowledge a step further and began implementing a 3D
              game engine, built in C++. I am enjoying solving complex puzzles
              that have already emerged, like collision detection and physics
              calculations.

              Chess has always fascinated me. The number of possible positions is 
              near uncountable and has even been given a name - Shannon's number. 
              After taking a computer vision course, I knew exactly how to apply 
              my newfound knowledge; and perhaps win a few chess games by the end.
              <br><br>
              And so, I designed a program which uses a convolutional neural
              network to convert a given image into a digital board position.
              The network trained on an online dataset of top-down chess boards.
              Each image was divided up into 64 different inputs, found by using
              a line detection algorithm to split the board up into it's squared
              in order to run the model on a single piece at a time. The outputs
              were then stitched back together in order to create a final board
              output. 
              <br><br>
              Though I did not complete an AI that played well enough to present
              a challenge to Stockfish, I used an online library which I could
              pass the board state into to produce the best move given the input
              position. I knew a few victories were in my future!

              I used to run my hands through my three LEGO bins, hunting for the
              piece I needed to complete my creation. In my frustration I
              dreamed of being able to produce just the piece I needed, in the
              color I wanted, in the time that I felt I didn't want to waste.
              When I heard about 3D printers, I was mystified at the prospect
              that my dream might finally come true.
              <br><br>
              When I was finally given the chance in high school, I jumped.
              Along with two of my friends, and the help of a kind and wonderful
              mentor, I began learning about 3D printing and the engineering
              process. We worked as a team to complete a 3D printer for our
              mentor, built entirely from scratch. Once satisfied with our
              handiwork, we used the now functional printer to fashion parts for
              our own 3D printers.
              <br><br>
              After a few months of "brute force and ignorance", as our mentor
              called it, each of us had finally completed our own working Prusa
              i3 printer from scratch! Using my SolidWorks knowledge, I was not 
              only able to print the LEGO pieces I desired, but also design my own
              LEGO pieces that no one had ever seen before!
